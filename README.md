# Python Discord Bot (with Gemini AI)

This is a Discord bot built with `discord.py` that was created as a project for Codedex. It has been expanded to include generative AI responses using the Google Gemini API.

## 🚀 Features

* **Meme Command**: Responds to `$meme` by fetching a random meme from the `meme-api`.
